						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

					<div class="section-content">
						<h3>Do I need art experience?</h3>
						<p>No! We welcome volunteers of all backgrounds. Lesson plans and materials are provided, and you'll have support from experienced volunteers.</p>

						<h3>What if I have to miss a session?</h3>
						<p>Let your coordinator know as soon as possible so we can arrange coverage. Occasional absences are understandable, but consistent attendance is important for building relationships with students.</p>

						<h3>Can I get involved if I don't have an SSN?</h3>
						<p>Unfortunately, as of 2026, NYC DOE requires an SSN for all volunteers in public schools. However, you may still be able to volunteer at non-DOE partner sites. Contact us for more information.</p>

						<h3>Who do I contact if I have questions?</h3>
						<p>Reach out to your site coordinator or email us at <a href="mailto:aro@communityimpact.columbia.edu">aro@communityimpact.columbia.edu</a>.</p>
